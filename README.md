# Product Funnel & Revenue Loss Analysis 💸

This project simulates a product funnel analysis for a SaaS FinTech company. The goal is to identify where users drop off in the signup process and estimate how much revenue is lost — and could be gained — at each stage.

---

## 🔍 Problem Statement

In any digital product, users go through multiple steps before becoming paying customers. Many users drop out before completing the flow, leading to loss of revenue. This project answers:

- Where are users dropping off?
- How many users complete each step?
- How much potential revenue is lost at each drop?
- What happens if we increase conversion by 10% at each step?

---

## 📊 Funnel Stages

The user journey is divided into four steps:

1. `signup`
2. `email_verified`
3. `bank_details_entered`
4. `payment_done`
